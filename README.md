# World-Cup-Database-and-Queries

This is the second project for the Relational Database course on freeCodeCamp.

For this project, I was able to easily set up a database from scratch as I have gained more experience in doing so while doing the modules. I was also able to apply the lastest concepts that I learned from the course, which are setting up bash scripts and querying a databse.

With the ability to create bash scripts, I was able to automate the process of populating a database from a .csv file. This included learning about if and while to make these scripts work.

With querying, I was able to get some insights from the data. This included applying WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, FULL JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, INNER JOIN, and aggregate functions in SQL (there may be more). It was not discussed in the modules but I learned and made use of UNION on my own as there was a task in this project that I think was beyond the ability of the things I learned on.
